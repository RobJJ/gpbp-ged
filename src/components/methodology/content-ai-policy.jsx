        Generative AI & Policy
      </h2>
      <p>
        Generative AI is the type or Artificial Intelligence which is capable of
        generating content. Generative AI is powered by large-data and AI
        foundation models built upon millions of valuable and reliable data. The
        models are then capable of multi-tasking, performing tasks which are not
        necessarily straightforward (e.g.: Summarization, Q&A, classification,
        analysis, recommendations, etcâ€¦) Currently, the infrastructure is
        available to be able to use these large models and adapting them for
        specific targeted use-cases based on personal/entity needs. Due to the
        large amount of resources available online, this requires minimal
        training data and thus the potential for the personalization of
        Generative AI services is vast. Still, using Generative AI for
        specific-use cases is a relatively new industry. It is constantly
        changing and the possibilities of its implementation becoming vaster day
        by day. However, this implies that working in this field also requires
        consistent adaptation and learning.

        In terms of policy making, generative AI can be a catalyst for more
        efficient, inclusive and responsive government through many services
        such as:
