The Green Economy Diagnostic (<a href="https://gpbp-ged.vercel.app" target="_blank">GED</a>) is a tool that maps the economic
and environmental performance of sub-national regions within a
country. It is designed to provide a comprehensive picture of the
performance of districts in terms of both economic and environmental
factors. Further insights are provided by leveraging the capabilities of Generative AI.
