1. Make whole app use IDs instead of names. URL, data fetching, etc
   country/district_id/province_id
   This will make all aspects simplier and safer, only at the cost of url name

2. Rebuild system using point1 above, and implement caching from start

3. Rebuild the Regional Insights section cards - duplicated the cards for trends, recomm etc

4. Tidy up the way the districts inside the provinces display their red selected border style... we need to organise the cards so that the district is ontop... might add more complexity to the situation... I wonder if having better geo data will solve this problem?
